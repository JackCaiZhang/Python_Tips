        00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.740
        What is machine learning?
        什么是机器学习？

        2
        00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.090
        You probably use it dozens of times
a day without even knowing it.
        您可能会使用它数十次
甚至不知道的一天。

        3
        00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.790
        Each time you do a web search on Google or
Bing, that works so well
        每次您在 Google 或
Bing，效果很好

        4
        00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.340
        because their machine learning software
has figured out how to rank what pages.
        因为他们的机器学习软件
已经弄清楚如何对哪些页面进行排名。

        5
        00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.230
        When Facebook or Apple's photo application
recognizes your friends in your pictures,
        当 Facebook 或 Apple 的照片应用程序
认出你照片中的朋友，

        6
        00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.850
        that's also machine learning.
        这也是机器学习。

        7
        00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.370
        Each time you read your email and
        每次您阅读电子邮件并

        8
        00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.490
        a spam filter saves you from having
to wade through tons of spam, again,
        垃圾邮件过滤器可以帮助您避免
再次费力地浏览大量垃圾邮件，

        9
        00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.390
        that's because your computer has learned
to distinguish spam from non-spam email.
        那是因为你的电脑已经学会了
区分垃圾邮件和非垃圾邮件。

        10
        00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.240
        So, that's machine learning.
        这就是机器学习。

        11
        00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.260
        There's a science of getting computers to
learn without being explicitly programmed.
        让计算机成为一门科学
无需明确编程即可学习。

        12
        00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.660
        One of the research projects that I'm
working on is getting robots to tidy
        我正在进行的研究项目之一
致力于让机器人打扫卫生

        13
        00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.780
        up the house.
        上房子。

        14
        00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.010
        How do you go about doing that?
        你打算怎样做呢？

        15
        00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.860
        Well what you can do is have the robot
watch you demonstrate the task and
        那么你能做的就是拥有机器人
观看您演示任务并

        16
        00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.000
        learn from that.
        从中学习。

        17
        00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.690
        The robot can then watch what objects
you pick up and where to put them and
        然后机器人可以观察什么物体
你拿起它们并将它们放在哪里

        18
        00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.000
        try to do the same thing
even when you aren't there.
        尝试做同样的事情
即使你不在场。

        19
        00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.460
        For me, one of the reasons I'm
excited about this is the AI, or
        对我来说，我的原因之一
对此感到兴奋的是人工智能，或者

        20
        00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.530
        artificial intelligence problem.
        人工智能问题。

        21
        00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.209
        Building truly intelligent machines,
        构建真正的智能机器，

        22
        00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:01.680
        we can do just about anything that you or
I can do.
        我们可以做任何您或
我能做到。

        23
        00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.920
        Many scientists think the best way to
make progress on this is through learning
        许多科学家认为最好的方法是
通过学习才能取得进步

        24
        00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.630
        algorithms called neural networks,
which mimic how the human brain works, and
        称为神经网络的算法，
模仿人类大脑的工作方式，并且

        25
        00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.030
        I'll teach you about that, too.
        我也会教你这一点。

        26
        00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.170
        In this class,
you learn about machine learning and
        在这堂课上，
你了解机器学习并且

        27
        00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.390
        get to implement them yourself.
        自己去实施它们。
